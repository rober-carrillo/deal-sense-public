Thank you for the detailed questions about our security compliance. As requested, here are the specifics:

1. SOC 2 Type II certification (renewed annually)
2. GDPR compliance with data residency options
3. End-to-end encryption for all data in transit and at rest
4. Regular penetration testing by third-party security firms

I noticed you mentioned your daughter is studying computer science at MIT - that's fantastic! Our CTO actually graduated from MIT's CSAIL program. 

I've attached our complete security documentation and compliance certificates. Would you like to schedule a 30-minute call with our security team to address any remaining concerns?

Looking forward to moving forward with the proposal.

Best regards,
Alex`,

Quick question - can your platform integrate with Slack and Teams simultaneously? 

Our dev team uses Slack but exec team is on Teams. Want to make sure we can push notifications to both.

Also, any chance you'll be at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference next month? Would love to grab coffee if you're there.

Cheers,
Mike

P.S. Shot a 78 at Pebble Beach last weekend! Getting better ðŸ˜„`,
